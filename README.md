🌌 Sanctuary of Forgotten Stars

Sanctuary of Forgotten Stars is my personal website and portfolio—a quiet corner of the web where my work, ideas, and experiments live. It’s part archive, part laboratory, part constellation map of things I’ve built and things I’m still becoming.

This site is intentionally minimal, reflective, and a little cosmic.

✨ Purpose

Serve as my personal homepage

Showcase selected IT projects

Act as a medium for me to harness my programming skills

Provide a space for experimentation and ideas that don’t fit neatly elsewhere

📜 License

Unless otherwise noted, the code is open for learning and inspiration.
The content and writing are personal and not intended for reuse without permission.

⭐ Final Note

This site is a sanctuary—not a finished product.
If you’re here browsing the source, welcome. Feel free to wander.
